â€¢ wordle.c:

! The implementation of the Wordle game!

-> Observations:
        - The graphic interface was created through the "ncurses" library;
        - When running the game, a start menu will be displayed (menu() function)
        in which the player can start a new game or exit the application;
        - If "New Game" is selected, the game() function will be called which will generate it
        the game board and will wait for the input from the keyboard;
        - At the beginning of the game, a random word will be chosen from the dictionary,
        using the rand() command, starting from seed time(0), that is
        current time instant;
        - Initially the boxes are printed, and then based on the received input
        the following actions will be taken:
                1. If a lowercase letter is entered, it will be inserted
                word and it will be displayed (as long as it is not exceeded
                the length of 5 letters of the word);
                2. If BACKSPACE is entered, the last letter a will be deleted
                the word both from memory and on the screen (if not already
                there is no letter to delete in the word, nothing happens);
                3. If ENTER is entered, check if there are enough
                letters in the word, if yes, the function is called
                checkWord(), in negative case a message is displayed;
                4. If ":" is entered, the menu opens (called
                menu function);
                5. If any other character is entered, nothing happens;
        - The checkWord() function checks if the entered word is the one you are looking for,
        in the affirmative case it calls the gameWon() function, in the negative case it colors
        the letters based on the rules of the game. Also, if it was introduced
        the last word, and this is not the one searched for, the function is called
        gameLost();
        - The gameWon() function generates the screen where the player is announced
        that he just won and gets the option to start a new game or
        to close the game;
        - The gameLost() function generates the screen where the player is announced
        that he just lost, the word that had to be found is displayed and he receives it
        the option to start a new game or close the game;
        - The choiceBox() function generates the choice box containing "New Game"
        and "Quit" related to the functions menu(), gameWon() and gameLost();
